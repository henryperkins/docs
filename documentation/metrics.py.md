# Overview

**File:** `metrics.py`  
**Language:** python  
**Path:** `metrics.py`  

## Summary

The 'metrics.py' file is designed to compute various software metrics for a given piece of code. This includes Halstead complexity metrics, cyclomatic complexity, and maintainability index. These metrics aid in understanding code complexity, effort required for maintenance, and overall code quality. The file provides functions to calculate individual metrics as well as a comprehensive function that returns all metrics. Additionally, it includes several variables and constants used within these calculations.

## Recent Changes

- Added detailed docstrings for functions.
- Refactored variable names for clarity.
- Updated Halstead metrics calculation logic.
