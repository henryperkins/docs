# Overview

**File:** `metrics.py`  
**Language:** python  
**Path:** `metrics.py`  

## Summary

The 'metrics.py' file provides functionality to calculate various code metrics, including Halstead complexity metrics, cyclomatic complexity metrics, the maintainability index, and all available metrics for source code. These metrics are essential for analyzing the complexity, maintainability, and overall quality of code. The functions leverage Radon's capabilities to perform detailed analyses and return comprehensive metric data in structured formats.

## Recent Changes

- Improved docstring descriptions for function return values.
- Added example usages for variables and constants (placeholders).
- Updated Halstead metric calculations.
