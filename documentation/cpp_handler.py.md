# Overview

**File:** `cpp_handler.py`  
**Language:** python  
**Path:** `language_functions/cpp_handler.py`  

## Summary

This module, 'cpp_handler.py', provides functionality for handling C++ code. It allows for extracting structures from C++ code, inserting documentation comments, and validating the code syntax. It serves as a handler to integrate with external C++ parsing and documentation tools, facilitating the processing of C++ source files and enhancing them with automatically generated documentation.

## Recent Changes

- Improved the method for extracting structure from C++ code.
- Added detailed documentation for the CppHandler class and its methods.
- Refactored the process for validating C++ code syntax.
- Introduced variables to manage paths to external scripts and executable files.


# Code Structure

## Classes

### CppHandler

Handler for the C++ programming language that facilitates the extraction of code structures, insertion of documentation, and validation of syntax.

#### Methods

| Method | Description | Complexity |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `__init__` | Initializes the `CppHandler` with a function schema. | 1 |
| `extract_structure` | Extracts the structure of the C++ code, analyzing classes, functions, and variables. | 6 |
| `insert_docstrings` | Inserts comments into C++ code based on the provided documentation. | 5 |
| `validate_code` | Validates C++ code for syntax correctness using 'g++' with the '-fsyntax-only' flag. | 5 |
