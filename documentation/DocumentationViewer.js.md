# Overview

**File:** `DocumentationViewer.js`  
**Language:** javascript  
**Path:** `documentation-viewer/src/components/DocumentationViewer.js`  

## Summary

The file is intended to implement a component structure for viewing documentation in a React application. However, it appears that there is an issue with the parser, and the structure couldn't be analyzed correctly. Hence, it seems the file might be empty, misconfigured, or not correctly parsed.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the component structure.
- Resolved parsing errors.
