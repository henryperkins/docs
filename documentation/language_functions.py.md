## Summary

This module provides functionality for handling language-specific documentation insertion into code files. It defines factory functions to select appropriate handlers based on the programming language and facilitates the insertion of documentation comments. It also manages the loading of function schemas required for annotating the source code with relevant docstrings or comments.

## Recent Changes
