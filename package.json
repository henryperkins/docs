  "description": "This project is a Python-based tool that automates the generation of documentation for code repositories. It scans through the files in a given repository, extracts the structure of the code (functions, classes, methods, etc.), and uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API to generate docstrings or comments. The script supports multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. The generated documentation is then inserted back into the original code files and can also be compiled into a Markdown file.",
