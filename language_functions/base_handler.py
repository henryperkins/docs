base_handler.py

This module defines the abstract base class `BaseHandler` for language-specific handlers.
Each handler is responsible for extracting code structure, inserting docstrings/comments,
and validating code for a specific programming language.

Classes:
    - BaseHandler: Abstract base class defining the interface for all language handlers.

        Extracts the structure of the code (classes, functions, etc.).

        This method should parse the source code and identify key components such as
        classes, functions, methods, variables, and other relevant elements.

        Args:
            code (str): The source code to analyze.
            file_path (str): Path to the source file.

        Returns:

        Validates the modified code for syntax correctness.

        This method should ensure that the code remains syntactically correct after
        inserting docstrings/comments. It may involve compiling the code or running
        language-specific linters/validators.
